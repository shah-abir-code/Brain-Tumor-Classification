🔬 Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning (TensorFlow | CNN)

This project focuses on building an AI-powered system for automated brain tumor detection using MRI images. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed with TensorFlow and Keras to classify MRI scans into tumor and non-tumor categories with high accuracy.

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. The data was preprocessed, augmented, and split into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure robust model performance.

⚙️ Key Features:

Implemented CNN architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, and Dense layers.

Used image_dataset_from_directory() for efficient data loading and preprocessing.

Applied EarlyStopping to prevent overfitting and enhance generalization.

Achieved high classification accuracy on the test dataset.

Integrated KaggleHub for automated dataset download and management.

💻 Tech Stack:
Python | TensorFlow | Keras | NumPy | Matplotlib | KaggleHub

🎯 Outcome:
Developed a reliable deep learning model that can assist in early brain tumor detection, contributing to faster diagnosis and improved medical research.
